# SLEEPDEEP
NodeJS Web Application for Internet Of Things Assignment Part2
Made By Tan Ru Bin, Chen Yan Jiun and Kennard

## Description
For this project, we decided to build an IoT system which studies the sleep pattern of adult and children alike by observing the environment that they sleep at. We acheive this through the use of a graph which shows the relationship between the temperature in the room and frequency of motion from the person. To provide a better sleeping experience, users will be able to remotely control the night light in the parent/baby's room from this web application.

Moreover, a temperature sensor is installed in the room to ensure that the room is of optimal temperature. If the temperature were to be too hot/cold, a message would be sent to the phone number set.

## Tutorial
The 'Manual' folder contains the Step-By-Step to setting up this IoT project and neccesary account creations in IBM.

The codes mentioned in our Step-By-Step can be found in the 'Codes' Folder. (Such as flow nodes for IBM & Raspberry Pi and css/js/images folder)
