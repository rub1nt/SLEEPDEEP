# SLEEPDEEP
NodeJS Web Application for Internet Of Things Assignment Part2
Made By Tan Ru Bin, Chen Yan Jiun and Kennard

## Description
For this project, we decided to build an IoT system which studies the sleep pattern of babies by observing the environment that the babies sleep at. We acheive this through the use of a graph which shows the relationship between the temperature in the room and frequency of motion from the baby. To provide a better sleeping experience for the baby, parents are able to remotely control the night light in the baby's room from this web application.

Moreover, a temperature sensor is installed in the baby's room to ensure that the room is of optimal temperature. If the temperature were to be too hot/cold, a buzzer would sound off in the parents room to alarm them.
